# Info
This project was made for making Doomfist Parkour (HAX's framework) map data creation easier in the absence of inspector.  

Both of the versions have the same features like adding/editing/deleting cps, effects, missions.  
But the OCR version has an extra feature that can extract coordinates from a screenshot. That's why the file size is big for that one.  
OCR version will only work for Windows 10.0.19041.0 and above. The default version should work for Windows 7 and above. (Both of the versions need .NET 6.0)

If you think the executables are malicious, you can build it from the source code yourself :agreege:
